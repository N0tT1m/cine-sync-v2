This is the **movie hybrid recommendation system** designed specifically for **movies**. It combines collaborative filtering with content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## System Overview

- **Type**: Movie-focused hybrid recommendation system
- **Architecture**: Collaborative filtering + content-based neural network
- **Training Data**: MovieLens 32M + TMDB + Netflix movie datasets
- **Features**: User embeddings, movie embeddings, genre encoding
- **Optimized For**: 58K movies, 280K users, 32M ratings

## Key Components

### Model Architecture
- **HybridRecommenderModel**: Core neural network for movie recommendations
- **Embedding Layers**: User and movie embeddings for collaborative filtering
- **Neural Network**: Multi-layer perceptron for rating prediction
- **Content Features**: Genre-based content filtering

### Core Files
- `models/hybrid_recommender.py` - Main movie recommendation model
- `models/content_manager.py` - Movie content management
- `main.py` - Training and inference for movies
- `config.py` - Configuration for movie system

## Training

```bash
# Train the movie model
python main.py --epochs 20 --batch-size 64

# Simple training
python train_simple.py --epochs 20 --batch-size 128
```

## Usage

```python
from models.content_manager import LupeContentManager

# Initialize movie content manager
manager = LupeContentManager("models")
manager.load_models()

# Get movie recommendations
recommendations = manager.get_recommendations(
    user_id=123, 
    content_type="movie", 
    top_k=10
)
```

## Performance Metrics

- **RMSE**: 0.147 (rating prediction accuracy)
- **Hit Rate@10**: 83.2% (relevant recommendations in top 10)
- **Coverage**: 94.7% (percentage of movies recommendable)
- **Training Time**: ~45 minutes (RTX 4090)

## Discord Bot Integration

The Discord bot in this directory provides movie-focused commands:

```
/recommend movie 5      # Get 5 movie recommendations
/similar "The Matrix"   # Find movies similar to The Matrix
/rate "Inception" 5     # Rate a movie
```

This system is the foundation of CineSync and has been proven effective for movie recommendations.
