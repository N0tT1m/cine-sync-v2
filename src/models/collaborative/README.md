# Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

Deep learning approach to collaborative filtering using neural networks to learn user-item interactions.

## Model Architecture
- Embedding layers for users and items
- Multi-layer perceptrons for interaction modeling
- Matrix factorization component integration

## Dataset Requirements
- User-item interaction data with ratings
- Minimum 100K+ interactions recommended
- Current dataset: 32M+ movie ratings, 12M+ anime reviews
